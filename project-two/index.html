        <img src="images/PRHS.png" alt="Prairie Ridge High School" class="center" id=wolf> 
        <p> I was born in Wheeling, IL and lived there for the first ten years of my life. I attended Mark Twain Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade. My fraternal twin brothers, my parents, and I moved to Crystal Lake, IL. I attended North Elementary school for fifth grade. I then attended Hannah Beardsley Middle school for sixth through eighth grade. During my teenage years I played basketball and did behind-the-scenes work for the theater club. After eighth grade graduation, I moved on to Prairie Ridge High School (PRHS). For freshman through senior year, I attended PRHS. My first two years I played basketball. I suffered an injury my freshman year which ultimately led to my basketball career ending. During my junior and senior year, I was a writer for the newspaper.</p>
